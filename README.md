# Restaurant Reviews App
### Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program

This app is Project 5 in the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program. This project is an exercise in taking a poorly designed website and improving its responsiveness, accessibility, and implementing a Service Worker.

### How to Use

1. Download the project to a folder on your local machine. 

2. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000` or `python -m http.server 8000` if you don't have Python 2.x installed. If you don't have Python installed at all, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000` and have fun!
